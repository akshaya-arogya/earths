        <h3>what is hapening to the ocean</h3>
        <h4>The oceans are one of Earth’s greatest gifts to humans, beautiful and valuable ecosystems teeming with life
            that provide everything from fresh food to careers for the millions that would otherwise be out of work.
            These seas that we are so dependent on may seem perfectly healthy, but not everything is as it appears. The
            oceans are like a slowly wilting flower that has been beaten down over the years and is now shedding its
            last petals. If something is not done soon to fix the mess that humanity has made, then it will be too late
            to save some of the irreplaceable species that make lives easier each and every day. Marine life
            conservation is a method that is working to save some of those petals. This type of conservation works to
            save species of the ocean and the aquatic habitats in which they reside. This essay will cover the topics of
            what marine life conservation is, what will happen if action to save the ocean is not taken, and possible
            solutions to the problem of pollution in the seas. While the mistakes of the past will always affect the
            future, there is still time to create a better outcome, and it starts with being educated on the issue at
            hand.
            <br>
            As you can see, the oceans' current predicament is far from good. Pollution is constantly being pumped out
            into these large bodies of water, and every day thousands of animals die from it. Whether a turtle is
            strangled by the plastic rings that formerly joined together bottles of soda or inhales the sewage dumped
            into his home, it has the same effect. Marine life dies. Many people are already aware of this but do not
            like to think of the consequences of their actions. It is inconvenient for them, and, as a result, animals
            die. How many more seconds of your day would it take to cut up those plastic rings? What about finding a
            more eco-friendly solution to getting rid of waste? The answer: not very many. If you know for sure that
            this would safe lives, human or otherwise, why would you put it off?
            <br>
            There is a reason why marine life conservation is considered so important, and it is because of how
            essential oceans are to the existence of every creature on this planet. Oceans are a huge source of oxygen
            for organisms everywhere and are very helpful in the processes of both storing and capturing carbon dioxide
            (“Marine Species”). As if providing half of the oxygen that humans breathe is not enough, they go on to make
            available other essential and vital resources for existence such as nourishment, medicines, and support for
            the costal economies of the world (“Protecting Oceans and Coasts”). The Great Barrier Reef alone houses 400
            types of coral, 1,500 species of fish, and 4,000 different mollusks. Located off of the coast of Queensland,
            Australia, it extends over 1,240 miles off the coast, and is not actually a single reef at all, but a chain
            of almost 3,000. Some coastlines are protected for reasons like this, and such is the case with some of the
            more sensitive coastlines in California on which the California Coastal Act of 1976 restricts development
            and building (Kerrigan, 42). Others, however, are not and therefore are subject to pollution. This problem
            has become more and more pronounced, and it is a costly mistake to fix. The Natural Resources Defense
            Council has analyzed a survey that was taken by 95 Californian communities, finding that the total of their
            annual reported costs for preventing litter from becoming pollution was $428 million dollars per year
            (“Solutions to Plastic Pollution in our Oceans”). That is around half a billion dollars that California
            could be using for other worthy causes but will not be able to because people simply refuse not to litter.
            Oceans cover around 70% of our planet and without them, many organisms would have ceased to exist long ago
            (“Marine Species”). Each of these organisms plays an important part in the upkeep of Earth, and so it is
            essential to respect that and keep in mind that biodiversity matters (“Marine Biodiversity”). Once a species
            becomes extinct, there is not any way to bring it back.

            <h4> Forests are rightly called as the lungs of the earth. They are the most important part of our ecosystem
                and
                are pivotal in maintaining the balance in the food cycle and the natural equilibrium on the planet.
                Forests
                cover almost 31% of the surface of the earth. They are a habitat for not only wildlife and trees but
                also to
                some of the rarest of rare animals and plants on earth.

                Man has been using the resources of forests for thousands of years. As much as the forest has provided
                man
                with his livelihood, man has not given back to the forest as much as he should have. And this overuse,
                imbalance and greed of man have led to a disturbance in the natural cycle of the earth.</h4>
